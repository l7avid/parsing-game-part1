# RULES

1. If one of the lines contains "split" find it;
2. Split it (use the split method from the string class)
3. Take the return from the split and write the element with index 4 into the output.txt
4. You have to add a space between each element to make it readable

# HINT -> If it is not a readable sentence, your answer is wrong.
